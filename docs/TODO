if the manage funds page is loaded first, the fund dropdown for imports never loads.
disable import forms untill the fund dropdown has loaded.
we don't need to call get_budget after adding or changing a fund, we can just update the display client side.
make sure that there is some "waiting" feedback when funds/entries are added/changed/deleted/imported
Need waiting feedback on logout.
make sure imported entries are inserted immediately into the display.

Use Log4perl for logging.
